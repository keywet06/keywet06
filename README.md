### Hey, here is keywet06, an OIer

My real name is Wentao Ying / Roy Ying (Chinese name / English name)

I'm currently learning OI competition as an OIer in Zhenghai Senior High School.

There are some repositories I maintain: 

- [keywet06/code](/keywet06/code) : Most of my OI coding source files
- [octinc/lightwolf](/octinc/lightwolf) : A web-based werewolf-killing project
- [octinc/lightwolf-core](/octinc/lightwolf-core) : The game core of lightwolf
- [WeKw/KwCode](/WeKw/KwCode) : A program help people code more quickly

I'm glad to see that somebody makes a contribution to these projects.

You can reach me at <keywet06@tom.com>

In the end, there are my accounts at some OI websites.
